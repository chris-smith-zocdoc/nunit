# NUnit 3.0 #

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nunit/nunit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nunit/nunit)

NUnit is a unit-testing framework for all .Net languages. Initially ported from [JUnit](http://www.junit.org/), the current production release, version 2.6, is the seventh major release of this xUnit based unit testing tool for Microsoft .NET. It is written entirely in C# and has been completely redesigned to take advantage of many .NET language features, for example custom attributes and other reflection related capabilities. NUnit brings xUnit to all .NET languages.

This repository is for the upcoming 3.0 version of the framework. The [vision](https://github.com/nunit/dev/wiki/NUnit-Vision) is that the NUnit 3.0 Extended Testing Platform will be a world-class platform for individuals and teams using a test-centric approach to .NET software development.

If you are interested in helping with NUnit development, we welcome bug reports, enhancements and pull requests. A great place to start is by reading the [Developer FAQ](https://github.com/nunit/dev/wiki/Developer-FAQ) and then checking the [outstanding issues](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues).

NUnit would also not be possible without the numerous contributions from the community. A complete list of contributors since NUnit migrated to Git can be [found on GitHub](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/graphs/contributors).

Earlier versions of NUnit were developed by Charlie Poole, James W. Newkirk, Alexei A. Vorontsov, Michael C. Two and Philip A. Craig.

We would also like to thank the following people for their contributions and support: Jamie Cansdale, Cvetomir Todorov, Doug de la Torre, David White, Ethan Smith, Al Gonzalez, Ron Jeffries and Rob Jeffries. A special acknowledgment needs to be sent to Kent Beck and Erich Gamma because without their efforts none of this would have been possible.
